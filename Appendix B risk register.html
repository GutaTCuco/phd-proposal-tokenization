    <h3>Appendix B: Risk Register (PMI Format)</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This Risk Register provides a systematic overview of the most critical risks identified for the real estate tokenization project in Portugal. Each risk is categorized, assessed for probability and impact, and assigned a specific response strategy with corresponding mitigation actions. This document serves as a key project management tool for proactively monitoring and controlling threats to the project's success.</p>
